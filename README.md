# miniprojects
A collection of small projects, to pursue interests or test understanding.

## Conway
A simulation of Conway's Game of Life. Developed by John Conway in 1970, building on the work of Stanislaw ULam and John von Neumann concerning self-replicating automata. Curiously it is Turing Complete. I include as an example and interesting start configuration which oscillates (found on Wikipedia).

## Review
A more practical use case of the Haskell language. Building a book review website. A single webpage site that updates items in a database and then renders them. I was impressed by the amount of support Haskell's libraries give for a task that is commonly reserved for imperative languages.
